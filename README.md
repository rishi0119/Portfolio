Hi, I’m Kunuguntla Rishika, a 3rd-year CSE-AIML student with a strong interest in AI technologies, full-stack development, and anything that challenges me to learn something new.

I enjoy building projects that mix creativity with real-world problem-solving—whether it’s experimenting with machine learning models, working on web apps, or exploring how AI can make everyday tasks easier.

I’m still learning and growing, but I’m always excited to take on new ideas, collaborate with people, and improve my skills step by step. My goal is to become a developer who builds meaningful, user-focused solutions powered by smart technology.
